      Enabling Network Traffic Obfuscation - Pluggable Transports
               draft-irtf-oliver-pluggable-transports-00

Abstract

   Pluggable Transports (PTs) are a mechanism enabling the rapid
   development and deployment of network traffic obfuscation techniques
   used to circumvent surveillance and censorship.  This specification
   does not define or limit the techniques themselves, but rather
   focuses on the startup, shutdown, and inter-process communication
   mechanisms required to make these technologies interoperable with
   applications.

   This document is based heavily on [PT2.1].

1.  Introduction

   The increased interest in network traffic obfuscation technologies
   mirrors the increase in usage Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to
   actively monitor the content of application data in addition to that
   data's routing information.  Deep Packet Inspection inspects each
   packet based on the header of its request and the data it carries.
   It can identify the type of protocol the connection is using even if
   it was encrypted.  DPI is not a mechanism to decrypt what is inside
   packets but to identify the 'protocol' or the application it
   represents.

   Deep packet inspection has become the prime tool of censors and
   surveillance entities who block, log and/or traffic-shape access to
   sites and services they deem undesirable.
   As deep packet inspection has become more routine, the sophistication
   of monitoring has increased to include active probing that
   fingerprints and classifies application protocols.  Thus, even as
   conventional care in application design has improved (via encryption
   and other protocol design features that encourage privacy), network
   traffic is still under attack.

   The techniques of network monitoring are changing and improving day
   by day.  The development of traffic obfuscation techniques that foil
   these efforts is slowed by the lack of common agreement on how these
   techniques are invoked, made easily interoperable with applications,
   and deployed quickly.  This specification addresses those issues.

   This specification describes a method for decoupling protocol-level
   obfuscation from an application's client/server code, in a manner
   that promotes rapid development of obfuscation/circumvention tools
   and promotes reuse across privacy tools such as VPNs and secure
   proxies.

   This decoupling is accomplished by utilizing helper sub-processes
   that implement the necessary forward/reverse proxy servers that
   handle the censorship circumvention, with a well defined and
   standardized configuration and management interface.  Any application
   code that implements the interfaces as specified in this document
   will be able to use all spec compliant Pluggable Transports.

2.  Background

   We define an Internet censor as any network intermediary that seeks
   to block, divert or traffic-manage Internet network connections for
   the purpose of eliminating, frustrating and/or logging access to
   Internet resources that have been deemed (by the censor) to be
   undesirable (either on a temporary or permanent basis).  A variety of
   techniques are commonly applied by Internet censors to block such
   traffic.  These include:

   1.  DNS Blocking

   2.  IP Blocking

   3.  Protocol and Port Blocking

   These techniques are applicable to a connection's metadata (IP
   routing information) and do not require inspecting the connection's
   datastream.

   DPI, in contrast, actually looks at the connection's datastream -
   often, specifically, the initial data elements in the stream (or
   within blocks of the stream).  These elements of the stream can
   contain clues as to the application-level protocol employed, even
   when the data itself is encrypted.  With repeated exposure, these
   clues ("fingerprints") can be learned by the censor and (along with
   the routing information) used to block or divert targeted traffic.

   A defense against this type of active probing is traffic obfuscation
   - disguising the application data itself in a manner that is less-
   easily fingerprinted.  But in early experiments, it quickly became
   clear that repeated use of the same obfuscation technique would,
   itself, be learned.  Methods were developed by which a single
   obfuscation technique could transform on its own TODO: cite FTE
   proxy, ScrambleSuit.  But, this approach proved expensive in terms of
   computational load.  Interest gathered in solving this problem and as
   more ideas arose so to did the need for a mechanism supporting rapid
   deploying of new obfuscation techniques.

   While intense work on network traffic obfuscation commenced initially
   and continues within the Tor Project (and across a wider set of
   external parties using Tor as a vehicle for research), vendors of
   other privacy-enhancing software (such as VPNs) quickly found their
   products also foiled by DPI.  Thus, it becomes important to see
   transport plug-ability as a mechanism implemented in a manner
   independent of a specific product or service.  The notion of
   "Pluggable Transports" (PT) was born from these requirements.

3.  Architecture Overview

   The PT Server software exposes a public proxy that accepts
   connections from PT Clients.  The PT Client transforms the traffic
   before it hits the public Internet and the PT Server reverses this
   transformation before passing the traffic on to its next destination.
   By default, the PT Server directly forwards this data to the Server
   App, but the Server App itself may itself be a proxy server and
   expect the forwarded traffic it receives to conform to a proxy
   communication protocol such as SOCKS or TURN.  There is also an
   optional lightweight protocol to facilitate communicating connection
   metadata that would otherwise be lost such as the source IP address
   and port EXTORPORT.

   When using the API on both client and server ("Transport API
   Interface"), the PT Client Library is integrated directly into the
   Client App and the PT Server Library is integrated directly into the
   Server App. The Client App and Server App communicate through socket-
   like APIs, with all communication between them going through the PT
   library, which only sends transformed traffic over the public
   Internet.

              Figure 1. API Architecture Overview

   When using the transports as a separate process on both client and
   server, the Dispatcher IPC Interface is used.  On the client device,
   the PT Client software exposes a local proxy to the client
   application, and transforms traffic before forwarding it to the PT
   Server.  The PT Dispatcher can be configured to provide different
   proxy types, supporting proxying of both TCP and UDP traffic.

           Figure 3. Mixed IPC and Transport API example

   Each invocation of a PT MUST be either a client OR a server.

   PT dispatchers MAY support any of the following proxy modes: PT 1.0
   with SOCKS4, PT 1.0 with SOCKS5, PT 2.0, transparent TCP, transparent
   UDP, or STUN-aware UDP.  Clients SHOULD prefer PT 2.0 over PT 1.0.

4.  Specification

4.1.  Pluggable Transport Naming

   Pluggable Transport names serve as unique identifiers, and every PT
   MUST have a unique name.  PT names MUST be valid C identifiers.  PT
   names MUST begin with a letter or underscore, and the remaining
   characters MUST be ASCII letters, numbers or underscores.  No length
   limit is imposed.  PT names MUST satisfy the regular expression [a-
   zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*.

4.2.  Transports API Interface

4.2.1.  Goals for interface design

   The goal for the interface design is to achieve the following
   properties:

   -  Transport implementers have to do the minimum amount of work in
      addition to implementing the core transform logic.

   -  Transport users have to do the minimum amount of work to add PT
      support to code that uses standard networking primitives from the
      language or platform.

   -  Transports require an explicit destination address to be
      specified.  However, this can be either an explicit PT server
      destination with the Server App is already known implicitly (the
      case with obfs4), or an explicit Server App destination with the
      PT server destination already known implicity (the case with
      meek).

Internet-Draft            Pluggable Transports                 June 2019


   -  Transports may or may not generate, send, receive, store, and/or
      update persistent or ephemeral state.

   -  Transports that do not need persistence or negotiation can
      interact with the application through the simplest possible
      interface

   -  Transports that do need persistence or negotiation can rely on the
      application to provide it through the specified interface, so the
      transport does not need to implement persistence or negotiation
      internally.

   -  Applications should be able to use a PT Client implementation to
      establish several independent transport connections with different
      parameters, with a minimum of complexity and latency.

   -  The interface in each language should be idiomatic and performant,
      including reproducing blocking behavior and interaction with
      nonblocking IO subsystems when possible.

4.2.2.  Abstract Interfaces

   This section presents high-level pseudocode descriptions of the
   interfaces exposed by different types of transport components.
   Implementations for different languages should provide equivalent
   functionality, but should use the idioms for each language, mimicking
   the existing networking libraries.

4.2.2.1.  Transport

   -  Transport takes a transport configuration and provides a Client
      Factory and a Server Factory.

   -  Transports may provide additional language-specific configuration
      methods

   -  The only way to obtain Client Factories and Server Factories is
      from the Transport.

   -  The Server Factory of the Transport can fail if the Transport does
      not provide a server-side implementation, such as in the case of
      the meek transport.  However, most transports provide both a
      client and server implementation.

   -  The transport configuration is specific to each T ransport.  Using
      a Transport requires knowing the correct parameters to initialize
      that Transport.

Internet-Draft            Pluggable Transports                 June 2019


4.2.2.1.1.  Client Factory

   -  Client Factory takes the connection settings and produces
      a Connection to that server.

   -  The connection settings are specific to each transport.  Some
      transports will also require an argument indicating
      the destination endpoint.  Producing a Connection may fail if the
      server is unreachable or if the transport configuration was
      incorrect.

4.2.2.1.2.  Server Factory

   -  Server Factory takes the address on which the PT server should
      listen for incoming client connections and produces a Listener for
      that address

4.2.2.1.3.  Listener

   -  Listener produces a stream of Connections

   -  New Connections are available whenever an incoming connection from
      the PT client has been established.  The language-specific API can
      adopt either a blocking or non-blocking API for accepting new
      connections, depending on what is idiomatic for the language.
      3.2.2.2.  Connection

   -  Connection provides an API similar to the environment's native
      socket type

   -  The connection object is extended to provide access to the
      underlying actual network socket used by the transport, so that
      low-level networking settings can be changed by the application.

   -  Connection is what is used to read and write data over the
      transport connection

   -  The transport-specific logic for obfuscating network traffic is
      implemented inside the Connection.

5.  Adapters

   This section covers the various different ways that the Pluggable
   Transport interfaces (both API and IPC) can be adapted to different
   use cases.

5.1.  API to IPC Adapter

   When an application and the transports it uses are written in the
   same language, either the Transports API or Dispatcher IPC can be
   used.  When they are in different languages, they must communicate
   through the Dispatcher IPC interface.  For maximum flexibility and to
   minimize duplication of effort across languages, dispatcher can be
   implemented by wrapping transport implementations that implement the
   Transports API.  For an example of this approach, see the
   Shapeshifter Dispatcher [https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/
   shapeshifter-dispatcher] , which wraps transports implementing the
   Transports API in the Go language and provides a Dispatcher IPC
   interface to use them from other languages.

5.2.  PT 1.0 Compatibility

   The only interface defined in the PT 1.0 specification is an IPC
   interface.  No standard API is defined.  Therefore, PT 1.0
   compatibility refers to compatibility between applications and
   transports where one side conforms to the PT 1.0 specification and
   the other conforms to the PT 2.0 specification.  Fortunately, an
   adapter is not needed in this case as both the PT 1.0 and PT 2.0
   specifications allow for version negotiation.  The
   TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER environment variable or -ptversion
   command line flag is used by the application to specify a list of
   supported versions, for instance "1.0,2.0".  The PT provider responds
   with the VERSION command on stdout in order to specify which version
   is supported by the PT provider, for instance "VERSION 2.0".  Since
   the application can specify a list of supported versions, the PT
   provider can respond dynamically, supporting PT 1.0 when required and
   automatically upgrading to a PT 2.0 implementation when that is an
   available option.  It is up to applications whether they want to
   support PT 2.0 exclusively or maintain backwards compatibility with
   PT 1.0 implementations.

5.3.  Cross-language Linking

   If two languages are compatible via cross-language linking, then a
   suitable adapter can be written that wraps the implementation of the
   Transports API in one language with an API for a compatible language.
   For example, on Android the Go implementation of the Transports API
   is wrapped in a Java API to create Java language bindings without the
   need for a native Java implementation or use of Dispatcher IPC.

5.3.1.  Using the Dispatcher IPC Interface In-process

   When using a transport that exposes the Dispatcher IPC interface, it
   may be more convenient to run the transport in a separate thread but
   in the same process as the application.  Packets can still be routed
   through the transport's SOCKS5 or TURN port on localhost.  However,
   it may be inconvenient or impossible to use STDIN and STDOUT for
   communication between these two threads.  Therefore, in some
   languages it may be appropriate to produce an "inter-thread
   interface" that reproduces the Dispatcher IPC interface's semantics,
   but replaces STDIN and STDOUT with language-native function-call and
   event primitives.  This is the approach used by OnionBrowser
   [https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/], the Tor implementation on iOS.
   This approach is used because Tor uses the Dispatcher IPC mechanism
   to talk to the transports instead of the Transports API.  However,
   iOS does not allow for applications to have multiple processes.
   Therefore, an in-process Dispatcher IPC approach must be used instead
   of traditional separate process Dispatcher IPC.  An alternative would
   be to use the Transports API directly instead of Dispatcher IPC.

5.4.  Anonymity Considerations

   When designing and implementing a Pluggable Transport, care should be
   taken to preserve the privacy of clients and to avoid leaking
   personally identifying information.  Examples of client related
   considerations are: - Not logging client IP addresses to disk.  - Not
   leaking DNS addresses except when necessary.  - Ensuring that
   "TOR_PT_PROXY"'s "fail closed" behavior is implemented correctly.

   Additionally, certain obfuscation mechanisms rely on information such
   as the server IP address and port being confidential, so clients also
   need to take care to preserve server side information confidential
   when applicable.
